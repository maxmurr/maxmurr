### Hey, I'm Max 👋

I'm a 22 year old full-stack engineer & gamer

## ⚡️ Current

Currently working at [INOX](https://inox.co.th/)

## 💎 Experience

I like to say that I am a full-stack developer, but I have most experience with frontend development, primarily [React](https://reactjs.org/) & [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). However for the past few years I have been focusing a lot more on backend development, primarily using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) & [GO](https://go.dev/).

Following from this, I spent 4 years studying Computer Science at [Kasetsart University](https://www.ku.ac.th/th), focusing on algorithms, data structures, and software engineering principles. I also explored advanced topics in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision using industry standard libraries such as [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/).
