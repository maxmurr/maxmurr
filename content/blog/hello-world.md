This is the first post on my blog. I'll be writing about software engineering, web development, and the tools I use day-to-day.

## What to Expect

I plan to cover topics like:

- **React & TypeScript** patterns I find useful
- **Performance** tips for production web apps
- **Tooling** and developer experience improvements
- Lessons learned from **real-world projects**

## Why a Blog?

Writing forces clarity. When I explain something in writing, I understand it better myself. This blog is as much for me as it is for anyone reading.

Stay tuned for more posts.
